Project manager with extensive experience of large **public sector** procurement
processes. I specialise in **logistics** and **cost reduction**. My greatest
strength is business awareness, which enables me to identify and address chokepoints
in processes. I am looking to move into a role that allows me to work on large projects
with opportuniries for customer interaction.
