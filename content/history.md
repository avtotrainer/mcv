  Some blurb about the job role and any particular success stories.

  Multiple paragraphs may be used, but for best results try to keep it to the point. As
  expected, **markdown** is fine too. As well as [normal
  links](https://www.example.com), you can also specify links in <a
  href="https://www.example.com" class="cv-url">this way</a> too. Adding in the extra
  `cv-url` class to your links means that the URL will be displayed in the print
  preview, which is handy for paper copies.

  * Bullet points are another approach you can take.
  * :warning: emojis are also supported - try not to overuse them though.
  * Add as many job entries as you like, but avoid including any information that isn't
    relevant in your CV. It's often a good idea to put the most recent experiences
    first.
