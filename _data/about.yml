# Each of these items will create a button in the contacts row. Add as many or as few as
# you like. Each item must have at least a 'name', 'value' and 'icon'. Everything else
# is optional.
# The icon names come from material design icons (https://materialdesignicons.com/). If
# no icon name is provided, the item name is assumed to be a valid MDI icon.
# You may also provide short and long descriptions for each item, which are used in
# responsive page designs.
